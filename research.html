                My project focuses on the diversity enabled by the modern aviation, so I wanted to focus my research on what did the world look like before mass air travel, what are made possible after the advent of mass air travel and how that connects to diversity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Flying is easily taken granted nowadays, but it is only some 50 years ago that the world witnessed the first milestone of mass air travel — Boeing 747. Before that, the only way of intercontinental traveling is ocean liner, and “making it to transatlantic and transpacific destinations around the world would take months” according to the article “The Airplane: What Would Modern Life Be Without It?” by Ryan Krautkremer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Naturally, in that setting, going somewhere on another continent is considered an arduous and long process, therefore only a handful of people can do that, and the mass could not dream of going somewhere so far, and our Earth were then a collection of isolated islands: most people stay in their little worlds, and detached from the rest, but it is not their intention to do so: "When our movement was limited, so were our options” (“Living in the Age of Airplanes”).
            </p>

            <p>
                But now, “when we enter an airport, we’re entering a portal to the planet: Each gate is a doorway to another part of the world. In a sense, we’re ‘walking distance’ to almost anywhere.” Says the narrator, Harrison Ford, in the National Geographic documentary “Living in the Age of Airplanes”. And I could not agree more, the concept of geological separation and remoteness itself has been blurred more and more with the development of commercial air travel, as our individual worlds became larger and larger, our collective world becaome smaller and smaller, to the extent that now, with our most cutting edge aircraft, Boeing 777, capable of flying 17,935 kilometers non-stop at a speed of nearly 1000 km/h, we can go between virtually any two points on Earth in just under 20 hours!
            </p>

            <p>
                Our Earth is no longer isolated islands, it is now a “Global village” in terms of the ease of traveling because of air travel, but perhaps the more profound aspect of this great achievement, is not the mere ease of traveling, it is the convergence of ideas, culture and understanding that contribute to the diversity we have today.
            
            </p>

            <p>
                People living in China can now easily witness the majesty of the Grand Canyon and people living in the United States can now readily set foot in the living history of the Forbidden City, these beautiful sights increase the understanding and add to the sympathy between the people of the two nations. 
            </p>


            <p>
                    International conventions are now held frequently around the world, they enabled us to work together and combine our discoveries and efforts, and thereby achieve much more than we ever could on our own: the outcomes of hundreds of conventions impact more than just the people who attend, they even affect those who have never flown. 
            </p>

            <p>
                    And for me personally, between home and UC Davis physically, is the Pacific Ocean, yet I am now able to come across the oceans and mountains, that have before blocked even the bravest explorers, to come here study in UC Davis, to receive a better education in whole different culture: thanks to modern aviation, between home and UC Davis, is only a ticket, and 12 hours of sleep in a comfy seat.
            </p>

            <p>
                These are all the fusion that the people before us could not even think of, yet we are enjoying such mirable, and created through it, an unprecedented level of diversity.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                    Therefore, the diversity we have today is closely connected to modern aviation and mass air travel, and this impetus is continuously pushing the diversity.
