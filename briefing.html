            <p>
                    
                Topic Summary: <br>
                    The topic for this project is how modern aviation connects our globe in an ever tighter fashion, and how the connection contributes to the diversity and the modern lifestyle as we know it: by diminishing the travel time between any two points on our Earth to just under 20 hours, the modern aviation enables an unprecedented level of exchange and fusion of people, material and most importantly, ideas, and this creates understanding and sympathy between peoples, and allows people from all over the world to work together in the goals of achieving much more than they could be working on their own.

                
            </p>

            

            <p>
                Target Audience: <br>
                People at the scene attending the DIS 2018 exhibition, people interested in aviation and people  interested in technology and diversity. They could be of all ages, but they do need to be curious about the aviation, diversity or just the way things work in general, because this project deconstructs an aspect of our lives to show how it became this way. And they should be used to interacting with digital media using mouse or touch in order to take full advantage of this project. Lastly, they will mostly be getting information from minor interactions with project.
            </p>

            
            <p>
                Project Goals and Workings: <br>
                The project aims to raise awareness and educate people on the significance of modern aviation and flying in general, by the showing how much difference it makes, and offer information about the development of modern aviation. And hopefully, inspire people to get interested in aviation or even engage in aviation-related studies or careers.
                The project works by utilizing the visualization of data and historical events to demonstrate the ability of aviation to transport people far and fast, some stories not possible without aviation, how aviation as a means of travel compared to the ones before it, and show the history of how our aviation industry came from almost impossible to nearly perfect in just under a century.

            </p>
                Communication Strategy: <br>

                The single most message is that: Aviation enables us to easily connect with the world that enables the exchange of ideas.

            <p>
                Look & Feel:<br>
                This project would take light color scheme representing people easily traveling in the world and the vision for a more diverse future. The interaction is minimal: mouse hovering, clicking and dragging should suffice. The typography would one of internationalism and universalism, like Helvetica, to hint the fusion of ideas.
